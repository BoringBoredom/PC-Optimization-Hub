# Importance of low input lag
  - ["While participants performed dragging and scribbling tasks, very low levels of latency could be discriminated, i.e., ~1 versus 2 milliseconds while dragging"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/In-the-blink-of-an-eye%3A-investigating-latency-Ng-Annett/386a15fd85c162b8e4ebb6023acdce9df2bd43ee)
  - [visual demonstration of 10 vs 1 milliseconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4&feature=youtu.be&t=80)
  - [NVIDIA article](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform/#so-what-is-latency-anyway)
# Physical setup
  - Make sure your outlets are properly grounded.
  - If you don't have enough outlets, buy a proper power strip ( < power conditioner < voltage regulator) and connect all devices directly to it. Only connect your hardware (no phone chargers and other stuff).
  - Disconnect all things you don't use from your motherboard. E.g. front USB, front audio, RGB, hard drive activity LED, system power LED, reset button etc.
  - Move all devices that have electric or electromagnetic fields away from your PC and peripherals. E.g. router, power strip/conditioner, voltage regulator etc.
  - Make sure none of your cables are touching each other and untangle them. This applies to everything, including power and peripheral cables.
  - Connect your mouse to the USB port closest to the PCH (Intel) / CPU (AMD). It's usually the one closer to the motherboard next to the PS/2 port(s).
  - If your motherboard has multiple USB controllers, offload your other devices to them. Lower their polling rates to an acceptable level. E.g. your microphone doesn't need 1000 Hz
  - Test both HDMI and DP on each GPU port (don't Plug & Play these).
# Peripherals
  - ## Mouse
    - ### Wired vs. Wireless
      - The convenience of cordless mice is very appealing. However, there are significant drawbacks. Nowadays, [2.4 GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.4_GHz_radio_use) is everywhere, causing a lot of interference. Additionally, aggressive [power saving mechanisms](https://i.imgur.com/5myJ46P.png) are implemented to increase battery life.
    - ### DPI
      - Depending on your preferred cm/360째 in games, you may want to experiment with different DPI. Higher DPI [decreases latency](https://twitter.com/Chris_Pate/status/871307822562107394) and improves motion clarity. Most modern sensors are able to handle around 1600 DPI without sensor smoothing. To counteract the increased sensitivity on the Desktop and in game menus you can adjust the [Windows sensitivity](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Mouse_Settings#Windows_Sensitivity).
  - ## Monitor
    - ### Capping FPS
      - [Input lag increases as GPU utilization increases](https://youtu.be/8ZRuFaFZh5M?t=817).
      - [Frame mistiming](https://youtu.be/_73gFgNrYVQ) causes severe stutters. To prevent this phenomenon you can cap your FPS at various values depending on your monitor's refresh rate. There are two formulae (X = monitor's refresh rate, Y = any integer):
        - X * Y
        - X / Y if X %Y = 0
      - Taking two refresh rate values as example, these are some of the FPS cap values that will prevent mistiming:
        - 360 Hz: ... , 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360, 720, 1080, ...
        - 240 Hz: ... , 48, 60, 80, 120, 240, 480, 720, ...
# BIOS
  - Generally, follow the principle of "Don't use it? Disable it." E.g. disable all power saving features, unused USB/PCI/SATA ports, RGB that can't physically be disconnected etc.

# Hardware clocking
  - I called this category *clocking* rather than *overclocking* because in the end all you do is run your silicon at its safe capabilities (which may not always be *over*clocking due to temperatures, for example).
  - [General Intel Lake clocking information](https://youtu.be/WK5Md-90XHQ)
  - ## CPU
    - Download the bootable version of [Linpack Xtreme](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/linpack-xtreme/) and mount it to a USB stick.
    - Set VCORE, VCCIO and VCCSA to what you consider safe 24/7 voltages for your hardware and set the [LLC](https://elmorlabs.com/index.php/2019-09-05/vrm-load-line-visualized/) to flat. Generally, a higher VRM switching frequency results in more stable voltage at the cost of increased temperatures.
    - Set All Core and Uncore (Cache) frequency to the *Processor Base Frequency* value displayed in the [Intel product database](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html). The reason for this is preventing your CPU from overheating by testing the waters first.
    - Boot into Linpack and stress test for a few minutes.
    - Monitor your temperatures and make sure you are below 80째C (you most likely will on stock frequency, unless your cooling is very bad).
    - Continue raising both All Core and Uncore by 100 MHz and do quick stress tests. Eventually, you will either encounter instability or temperatures above 80째C.
    - If temperatures are too high, you can try lowering VCORE (P = I x V).
    - If you encounter instability, lower All Core and Uncore by 100 MHz and continue raising All Core from now on.
    - Ultimately, stress test for 1-4h to maximize long-term stability.
  - ## RAM
    - [Importance of memory clocking](https://kingfaris.co.uk/ram)
    - Dedicated cooling is advised since ["charge leakage rate of DRAM cells approximately doubles for every 10째C increase in the temperature"](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/NVM/chargecache_low-latency-dram_hpca16.pdf).

# Windows
  - I highly recommend setting up a multi-boot environment to separate the gaming and the "can-be-bloated" operating system. Keeping your programs and files on a different partition is also convenient due to both operating systems having shared access to everything and the ease of reinstalling either of them.
  - As usual, disable everything you don't explicitely need.
