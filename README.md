# Importance of low input lag
  - ["While participants performed dragging and scribbling tasks, very low levels of latency could be discriminated, i.e., ~1 versus 2 milliseconds while dragging"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/In-the-blink-of-an-eye%3A-investigating-latency-Ng-Annett/386a15fd85c162b8e4ebb6023acdce9df2bd43ee)
  - [visual demonstration of 1 vs 10 milliseconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4&feature=youtu.be&t=80)
  - ["The average difference in aiming task completion (the time it takes to acquire and shoot a target) between a 12ms and 20ms PCs was measured to be 182ms - that is about 22 times the system latency difference."](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform/#why-does-system-latency-matter)
  - ["In all studies, the trend shows continued improvements all the way toward zero latency."](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/aiming-faster-in-games-with-low-computer-system-latency/)
# Disclaimer
  - Due to the sheer complexity of hardware and software and differences between various architectures, your mileage may vary. However, it is useful to be aware of things that can impact user experience and adjust them according to your needs.
  - Create a personal document and keep track of everything you do. Adopt a systematic approach with proper testing methodologies instead of just blindly changing many settings at once. Some settings are trade-offs between latency and consistency / graphics quality. Some settings may not show a visible impact at first due to other bottlenecks.
# Physical setup
  - [Electromagnetic interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference) and issues with electricity (e.g. [ground loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_loop_(electricity))) can cause unintended behavior of electronic components, potentially [increasing input lag](content/physical%20setup/emc%20problem%20list.md#list-of-forum-threads-from-users-reporting-increased-input-lag-due-to-lack-of-electromagnetic-compatibility-or-issues-with-electricity). Problems can occur due to [insufficient quality control](https://bit-tech.net/news/tech/motherboards_not_passing_emi_tests/1/) or [oversight regarding magnitude of impact from/on other independently manufactured components](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/3/14496044/lg-ultrafine-5k-display-router-fix-redesign). Here are [some resources](https://github.com/djdallmann/GamingPCSetup/blob/master/CONTENT/TECHNICAL%20REFERENCES/README.md#electrical) and a [short summary](https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7168&start=30#p62185).
  - Make sure your outlets are properly grounded.
  - If you don't have enough outlets, buy a proper power strip ( < power conditioner < voltage regulator) and connect all devices directly to it. Only connect your hardware (no phone chargers etc.).
  - [Disconnect all things you don't use from your motherboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=950XhSPanlA). E.g. front USB, front audio, RGB, hard drive activity LED, system power LED, reset button etc.
  - Move all devices that have electric or electromagnetic fields away from your PC and peripherals. E.g. [router](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoringBoredom/PC-Optimization-Hub/main/content/physical%20setup/router.jpg), power strip/[conditioner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoringBoredom/PC-Optimization-Hub/main/content/physical%20setup/conditioner.jpg), voltage regulator etc.
  - Make sure there is enough space between your [cables](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Improving_Phidgets_Hardware_Reliability#Device_Resets_.28Due_to_Cable_to_Cable_Interference.29) and untangle them. This applies to everything, including power and peripheral cables.
  - Check the USB layout of your system with [USB Device Tree Viewer](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbtreeview_e.html). Connect your mouse (or primary input device) to the first port of the first controller (usually [this port](https://i.imgur.com/QGKAVoA.png)).
  - If your motherboard has multiple USB controllers, [offload](https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7618) your other devices to them. Lower their polling rate to an acceptable level. E.g. your microphone doesn't need 1000 Hz
  - Test both HDMI and DP on each GPU port (don't Plug & Play these).
  - Keep your PC clean. Clogged heatsinks and dust filters will reduce airflow and consequently heat dissipation. Furthermore, ["dust may cause
electrical leakage, shorting and opening of PCBs under different conditions"](https://www.circuitinsight.com/pdf/impact_of_dust_ipc.pdf).
# Peripherals
  - ## Mouse
    - ### Wired vs. Wireless
      - The convenience of cordless mice is very appealing. However, there are significant drawbacks. Nowadays, [2.4 GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.4_GHz_radio_use) is everywhere, causing a lot of interference. Additionally, aggressive [power saving mechanisms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoringBoredom/PC-Optimization-Hub/main/content/peripherals/hero%20power%20saving.PNG) are implemented to increase battery life.
    - ### DPI
      - Depending on your preferred cm/360째 and FOV in games, you may want to experiment with different DPI. Higher DPI [reduces latency](https://twitter.com/Chris_Pate/status/871307822562107394) and [improves motion clarity](https://youtu.be/QrF_e5vKqPk). Most modern sensors are able to handle around 1600 DPI without sensor smoothing. To counteract the increased sensitivity on the Desktop and in game menus you can adjust the [Windows sensitivity](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Mouse_Settings#Windows_Sensitivity).
    - ### Polling rate
      - Higher polling rate reduces latency and [improves motion clarity](https://youtu.be/gOQNRvJbpmk?t=540) ([another example](https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7569)).
  - ## Monitor
    - ### Capping FPS
      - [Input lag increases as GPU utilization increases](https://youtu.be/8ZRuFaFZh5M?t=817).
      - [Frame mistiming](https://youtu.be/_73gFgNrYVQ) causes severe stutters. To prevent this phenomenon you can cap your FPS at various values depending on your monitor's refresh rate. There are two formulae (X = monitor's refresh rate, Y = any integer):
        - X * Y
        - X / Y if X %Y = 0
      - These are some of the FPS cap values that will prevent mistiming:
        - 360 Hz: ... , 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360, 720, 1080, ...
        - 280 Hz: ... , 40, 56, 70, 140, 280, 560, 840, 1120, ...
        - 240 Hz: ... , 48, 60, 80, 120, 240, 480, 720, 960, ...
        - 144 Hz: ... , 48, 72, 144, 288, 432, 576, 720, 864, 1008, ...
        - 120 Hz: ... , 40, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, 600, 720, 840, 960, 1080, ...
# BIOS
  - Generally, follow the principle of "Don't use it? Disable it." E.g. disable all power saving features, unused network/audio/SATA controllers, unused USB/PCI/DIMM/SATA ports, RGB that can't physically be disconnected etc.

# Hardware clocking
  - I called this category *clocking* rather than *overclocking* because in the end all you do is run your silicon at its safe capabilities (which may not always be *over*clocking due to temperatures, for example).
  - [General Intel Lake clocking information](https://youtu.be/WK5Md-90XHQ)
  - [Core](https://youtu.be/WK5Md-90XHQ?t=851), [Uncore and RAM](https://youtu.be/WK5Md-90XHQ?t=1116) affect each other's stability, hence there is no definitive order.
  - ## CPU
    - Download the bootable version of [Linpack Xtreme](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/linpack-xtreme/) and mount it to a USB stick.
    - Adjust [LLC and VRM switching frequency](https://elmorlabs.com/index.php/2019-09-05/vrm-load-line-visualized/).
    - Boot into Linpack and stress test for a few minutes.
    - Monitor your temperatures and make sure you are below 80째C.
    - Continue raising both All Core and Uncore by 100 MHz and do quick stress tests. Eventually, you will encounter either instability or temperatures above 80째C.
    - If temperatures are too high, you can try lowering VCORE (P = I x V).
    - If you encounter instability, lower All Core and Uncore by 100 MHz and continue raising All Core from now on.
    - Ultimately, stress test for 2-4h to maximize long-term stability.
  - ## RAM
    - [Importance of memory clocking](https://kingfaris.co.uk/ram)
    - Dedicated cooling is advised since ["charge leakage rate of DRAM cells approximately doubles for every 10째C increase in the temperature"](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/NVM/chargecache_low-latency-dram_hpca16.pdf).

# Windows
  - I highly recommend setting up a multi-boot environment to separate the gaming and the "can-be-bloated" operating system. Keeping your programs and files on a different partition (separate from operating system partitions) is also convenient due to all operating systems having shared access to everything and the ease of reinstalling either of them without having to back up your data.
  - As usual, disable everything you don't explicitely need.
  - The Task Manager is a very inaccurate representation of system load since it only displays Core usage on a very superficial level. It doesn't account for things like [context switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch) which can be very expensive. I recommend using [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) with [modified settings](content/windows/process%20explorer%20settings.reg) instead.
  - [NVIDIA Profile Inspector](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector) exposes a lot of settings that are hidden from the control panel.
  - Whenever possible, use portable versions of programs. Sometimes installers come with background services/drivers which may run even if the program is not running.
