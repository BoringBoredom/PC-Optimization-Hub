# Physical setup
  - Make sure your outlets are properly grounded.
  - If you don't have enough outlets, buy a proper power strip ( < power conditioner < voltage regulator) and connect all devices directly to it. Only connect your hardware (no phone chargers and other stuff).
  - Disconnect all things you don't use from your motherboard. E.g. front USB, front audio, RGB, hard drive activity LED, system power LED, reset button etc.
  - Move all devices that have electric or electromagnetic fields away from your PC and peripherals. E.g. router, power strip/conditioner, voltage regulator etc.
  - Make sure none of your cables are touching each other and untangle them. This applies to everything, including power and peripheral cables.
  - Connect your mouse to the USB port closest to your PCH (Intel) / CPU (AMD). It's usually the one closer to the motherboard next to the PS/2 port(s).
  - If your motherboard has multiple USB controllers, offload your other devices to them. Lower their polling rates to an acceptable level. E.g. your microphone doesn't need 1000hz
  - Test both HDMI and DP on each GPU port (don't Plug & Play these).
